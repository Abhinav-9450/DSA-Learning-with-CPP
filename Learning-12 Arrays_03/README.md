# C++ 1D Arrays-03

## Topics Covered

- Two pointer method in arrays
- sorting 0's and 1's
- Dutch flag method of sorting
- merge sorted arrays
- find next permutation
- trapping rain water

## Description

This folder contains C++ programs written to practise the problems in the 1D arrays which involves two pointer methods, dutch flag method, merge sorted arrays, next permutation, and trapping rainwwater. This helps in learning how we can optimise the solution in arrays using 2 pointer approach. 

📌 Code files inside demonstrate the above concepts.
