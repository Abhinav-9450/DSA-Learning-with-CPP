# C++ & DSA Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning of **C++ programming** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** through lectures and hands-on practice.

## About This Repository
- Learning C++ fundamentals along with DSA concepts
- Following lectures and implementing concepts in code
- Each folder represents a specific topic
- Code files contain practice programs and implementations
- README files briefly describe the topics covered

## Topics That would be covered include:

### C++
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators
- Input and Output (`cin`, `cout`)
- Control Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Arrays and Strings

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- Time and Space Complexity
- Arrays
- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Recursion
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues

## Goal
- Build strong foundations in C++
- Develop problem-solving skills using DSA
- Track learning progress consistently
- Create a structured, revision-friendly codebase
- Prepare for technical interviews

## Note
This repository will be **regularly updated** as I continue learning from lectures and practice.
